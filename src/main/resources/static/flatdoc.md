REST Countries üáµüá™
=======

Get information about countries via a RESTful API

*Current version: 3.1*

New in Version 3
-
Version 3 uses [this] project to get the country's structure and adds a couple of new features:

- Search by translations
- Search by language's name (not just language code)
- Search by currency's name (not just currency code)
- Turning back from V2 to V3: continent to region and region to subregion
- Population

In addition to those features, I added the flags (svg and png) to each country. 

In version 3 you get:

```json
"flags": [
  "https://restcountries.com/data/per.svg",
  "https://restcountries.com/data/png/per.png"
]
``` 
In version 3.1 you'll get:

```json
"flags": {
  "svg": "https://restcountries.com/data/per.svg",
  "png": "https://restcountries.com/data/png/per.png"
}
```

Important Information About Version 2
--
The structure has been reverted to its original form from the [Original Project] to maintain compatibility.

Please consider donating [$5], [$10], [$15] o [more]. This will allow me to pay the server's bills üòÉ

The original restcountries project was acquired by apilayer, one of the leading providers of 
API microservices. As the original project has shown very little activity, I created this project 
in order to provide a more updated version and with some fixes requested in the original project.
